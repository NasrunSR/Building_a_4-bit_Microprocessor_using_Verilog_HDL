# Building_a_4-bit_Microprocessor_using_Verilog_HDL

Microprocessors are widely used in many applications, including in computers, supercomputers, smart home devices and smart phones. 
We built a 4-bit Microprocessor using Verilog HDL as an assignment in our Digital System Design Course.
Our design of a 4-bit Microprocessor is mainly divided into three parts: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Data Registers and Control Logic using Verilog HDL.
